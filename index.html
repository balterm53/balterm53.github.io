					Engineer by training, maker at heart, always curious about how things work. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm a 5th-year biomedical engineering PhD candidate at Rutgers University studying robotics, intelligent systems, and computer vision. With support from an NSF graduate research fellowship (<a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF GRFP</a>), my thesis has focused on developing an automated device for rapid blood draws and point-of-care blood analysis. In fact, the core technology of the device was used to launch a biotech start-up - <a href="http://vasculogic.com/">VascuLogic</a>. During graduate school, I was fortunate to have the unique experience of working as an engineer at a biotech start-up, while at the same time, working as a research scientist at Rutgers, broadening my perspective on technology development and commercialization.
				</p>

				<p>
					As an undergraduate, I studied Mechanical Engineering at <a href="http://www.union.edu/">Union College</a> in Schenectady, NY and worked on a range of interesting design projects, such as a <a href="projects/dart-robot.html">dart throwing robot</a> and a <a href="projects/prey-simulator.html">3D flying prey simulator</a>. I was also passionately involved with the Engineers Without Borders (<a href="http://www.ewb-usa.org/">EWB</a>) student chapter, where our project focused on providing a clean water supply to Boru village in Northern Ethiopia. Our team was fortunate enough to travel to Ethiopia on a site assessment trip in August of 2011, partnering with Save the Children after receiving a <a href="http://www.davisprojectsforpeace.org/"> Davis Projects for Peace</a> Fellowship. 
				</p> 

				<p>
					I'm passionate about developing innovative technology to make a difference in people's lives.
